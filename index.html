    <h1>Creatine Supplementation and its Mitigating Effect on Doxorubicin-Induced Wasting of Skeletal Muscle</h1>
    <p>Cancer is a common yet devastating disease caused by mutation of cellular DNA and loss of cell cycle regulation. Such mutation, called transformation, occurs as a result of exposure to mutagenic factors such as radiation and UV rays or with no apparent cause. Cancer is expected to claim 13 million lives annually by 2030, and 21.7 million individuals are expected to be diagnosed annually by that year (“Global Cancer Facts & Figures”). Cancerous cells multiply rapidly, forming tumors, or masses of cancerous cells, and may metastasize, or migrate to other parts of the body, through the blood or lymphatic system, which poses an even greater danger. Cancerous cells disrupt bodily activities as they consume resources and disrupt tissue structure and function. Many types of cancer can be lethal.<br><br>
	Any drug or treatment that can destroy cancerous cells, therefore, is of prime importance. Tumors of appropriate size, location, and type may be surgically removed. Targeted radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells as their mutated genomes are more susceptible to further damage. These common treatments, however, fail to fight cancer outside a specific location; instead, chemotherapy treatments use chemicals that circulate throughout the body and destroy cancerous cells. These chemicals may include those that inhibit specific components of cell division or the cell cycle or may cause cell death. Doxorubicin, a specific cancer drug part of the anthracycline class of anticancer drugs, uses several methods to prevent the division or function of cancer cells (Yang, et al).<br><br>
	A critical side effect of doxorubicin treatment is myotoxicity. Treatment with doxorubicin has been found to downregulate myogenin and MyoD, two factors necessary for the production of muscle cells and the fusion of myoblasts (Yang, et al). This contributes to the loss of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. The current review will focus on the toxicity of doxorubicin toward skeletal muscle.<br><br>
	MyoD is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is essential for satellite cell differentiation in skeletal muscle after such cells have been activated by phenomena such as mechanical stress (Le Grand, Fabien and Michael A Rudnicki). The Id2 gene is inducible by doxorubicin as a result of its 5’ flanking region and is expressed in proliferating tissues. Id2 gene expression, however, is downregulated during differentiation (Kurabayashi, et al.). Since muscle cells rely on the migration and differentiation of satellite cells, muscle will not generate sufficiently since doxorubicin is inducing Id2 to inhibit MyoD and therefore satellite cell differentiation (Kurabayashi, et al.).<br><br>
	Creatine, a compound widely used by bodybuilders to enhance performance and to increase muscle mass, may indeed be an effective treatment for myotoxicity side effects associated with doxorubicin chemotherapeutic treatment. Deldicque, et al. studied the effects of creatine supplementation on several myogenic factors in C2C12 cells. MyoD expression as well as myogenin expression were significantly enhanced in comparison with control C2C12 cells.<br><br>
	Creatine supplementation dramatically increases creatine as well as phosphocreatine content within the body. Consumption of 20g/day for 5-7 days has been found to increase creatine stores by about 20% and phosphocreatine stores by about 25% (Krieder). Creatine supplementation has been found to increase performance in a variety of activities. While around 70% of short-term supplementation studies show improvements in performance or muscle mass, around 90% of long-term supplementation studies show improvements ranging from 10-100% (Kreider). No clinically significant side effects were reported (Kreider).<br><br>
	Creatine is taken up by skeletal muscle cells by means of a sodium-ion dependent transporter protein which transports creatine against the concentration gradient when it is consumed orally (Willoughby, Rosene). As the concentration of intracellular creatine increases, so does the expression of the creatine transport protein as well as the dimeric muscle creatine kinase isozyme (Willoughby, Rosene). In turn, MHC (myosin heavy chain) and myosin expression are up-regulated. Since such changes in muscle cause the recruitment of Type I and II motor units for Type I and II muscle fibers, MyoD expression increases since it is associated with with Type IIb muscle fibers and the Type IIx MHC isoform (Willoughby, Rosene).<br><br>
	Creatine also functions in the regeneration of ATP particularly in muscle cells by means of the creatine-phosphate system. As ATP is produced by ATP synthase in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it exits to the intermembrane space in exchange for ADP via the Adenine Nucleotide Transporter (Brosnan, et al.). This ATP can then phosphorylate creatine at points where both mitochondrial membranes touch via creatine kinase, producing phosphocreatine and ADP (Brosnan, et al.). Creatine phosphate can then be used to regenerate ATP in the cytosol with creatine kinase and ADP (Brosnan, et al.).<br><br>
	In order to assess whether creatine supplementation is an effective treatment for doxorubicin-induced inhibition of muscle regeneration, the rat model should be used. After treatment with differing concentrations of creatine, rats can be analyzed for physical strength through grip strength tests, in which rats are suspended and their ability to maintain grip on a stationary object while being pulled is quantified, as well as other assessments. Homogenized rat tissue supernatant can be separated through gel electrophoresis and then analyzed for MyoD concentration as an indicator of muscle regeneration at the molecular level.<br><br>

	  <h1>Methods and Materials</h1>
    <p>Several processes are necessary to analyze the mitigating effect of creatine on doxorubicin-induced inhibition of muscle regeneration. Animals (rats) must be treated with control (doxorubicin) and no added supplement to food pellets. Experimentally treated rats will also be administered doxorubicin but instead food pellets will contain varying concentrations of creatine. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. Rats were housed in an environmentally controlled facility with a 12 hr day/night cycle. Rats were allowed to consume water and rodent chow as they wish. Said rats were  sixty Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Harlan Laboratories of age ten weeks and average weight roughly 300 g (N=47). Rats were randomly assigned to control, doxorubicin, and creatine & doxorubicin groups. The creatine & doxorubicin group was fed chow supplemented with 3% creatine monohydrate and the control and doxorubicin groups received standard rodent chow. After two weeks on the stated diets, the creatine & doxorubicin as well as the doxorubicin groups received a bolus (15 mg/kg) intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of doxorubicin and the control group received an intraperitoneal saline injection as a placebo. Five days afterwards, each animal was anesthetized with heparinized (100U) sodium pentobarbital (50 mg.kg) and the heart, right soleus, and right extensor digitorum longus was excised, weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. It must be noted that rats were only sacrificed until after the tail pinch reflex was entirely absent. These techniques include but are not limited to anesthetic during sacrificial procedure and proper care for the rats within their habitations (ample space, water, and food should be provided). At regular intervals during the treatment, rats from all groups will be tested for grip strength; rats will be lifted by the tail by a trained researcher, and in response, the lifted rat will grip onto a specialized digital scale. The researcher will continue to pull the rat until the rat will no longer be able to hold onto the device, and the resulting output (in Newtons) will be recorded. This process will be repeated several times. These rats will later be sacrificed and calf (solis) muscle tissue from both legs will be obtained. This muscle will be first “hung” and tested for maximal strength. A quantitative measure of the maximal output (Newtons) for each muscle will be obtained. This muscle cell tissue will then be cut, stored in eppendorf tubes, and refrigerated at -70℃. Tissue homogenization will follow. Individual samples will be recruited from refrigeration at -70℃ and then weighed. If samples do not weigh between .07 - .1 g, then tissue must be discarded until the desired amount is available. This tissue is then placed into a glass mortar. For every hundredth of a gram, 10µL of Radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer as well as protease inhibitors are added to the mortar. This tissue, submerged within RIPA buffer and protease inhibitors, must then be mechanically homogenized until all color is lost from the sample. This tissue must then be sonicated ten times in one-second bursts. After sonication, the tissue is then homogenized mechanically with a pestle twice. The resulting fluid, without tissue, is poured from the glass mortar into an eppendorf tube. This eppendorf tube is labelled with the necessary identifying information that will allow determination of the organism and specific location within the organism from which the tissue was obtained. The sample is then immediately stored at -70℃. Once a sufficient amount of samples have been obtained to fill a centrifuge, samples are centrifuged at 10,000 RPM, 3000g, and 4℃ for 10 minutes. The supernatant is collected into another eppendorf tube as the tube containing both the pellet and supernatant is inverted. Afterwards, the eppendorf tube containing the pellet is discarded as the proteins of interest reside within the supernatant. The eppendorf tube containing the supernatant is then labelled with the same identifying information as the eppendorf tube. In order to standardize total protein concentration within the samples, a Genesys 20 photospectrometer (562 nm) was used to determine the concentration of proteins within the samples. RIPA buffer is added as needed to standardize concentration and labelled eppendorf tubes are stored at -70℃.<br><br>
	Equal volumes of Lammeli buffer are added to samples in microcentrifuge polypropylene vials. Protein concentration is reduced in half. Samples are heated in boiling water for two minutes then chilled on ice for 5 minutes. 46 ug are loaded onto 4-10% gradient tris-glycine NuPage precast cells obtained from LifeTechnologies in Carlsbad, California. Gels were run at 125 V and 4 mA for two hours in an Xcell II blot module obtained from Invitrogen LifeTechnologies. The process should be terminated when proteins have migrated through the whole gel.<br><br>
	The gel must be labelled such that the wells and their contents can be identified after electrophoresis and X-ray photography. For the purposes of this electrophoresis, 5 µL SeeBlue (Pre-Stained Standard) is added to the first well (Leftmost) so that the progression of the electrophoresis can be visualized. For ease of use and for accuracy, micropipette tips are held into ¾ the depth of the well and then the contents are purged slowly. The identification information on each eppendorf tube is recorded and the samples are stored in order on a silicone grid. Numbers are assigned to each sample that will correspond to a well number. Each sample is stored in order of well number on the silicone grid. The numbers corresponding to each sample are then written on the plastic cover of the gel. After all the samples have been labelled and micropipetted into the wells, the last well adjacent to the rightmost sample is micropippeted with 5 ul of Magic Marker (ladder). At the conclusion of two hours, the blue dye present within each sample should be visible within the foot of the gel. The electrophoresis module is deactivated and then the gel within its plastic container is removed. With a “prying” motion, a gel knife is used to separate the top plastic casing from the gel as well as the backing. To separate the gel from the backing, the gel with the foot is turned over into a gloved hand or a flat surface and the plastic backing is gently lifted. The foot of the gel is cut off and then discarded. In order to preserve the gel, the gel is continuously wetted with TBST. In order to prepare the transfer membrane, the .45 micron polyvinylidene flouride membranes are submerged in methanol and then DI water. 4 blotting pads, 2 filter papers, the transfer membrane, and the gel are loaded into a Transfer module as per the figure above, and the transfer is run at 25V for 100mA for 90 minutes. The gel is then discarded and the transfer membrane, now containing proteins, is blocked for 1 hour in a mixture of 15Ml TBST and 5% milk. Afterwards, 10 mL primary antibodies (rabbit monoclonal MyoD) are added to the membranes and the membranes are rocked overnight within the 10mL solution. The TBST and milk mixture is discarded. The membrane is washed by gently agitating the membranes in TBST on a rocker thrice for five minutes each time. Secondary antibodies obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology that correspond to the monoclonal MyoD primary antibodies are added to the membrane along with horseradish peroxidase and the solution and membrane are incubated for 1 hour. The membrane is then washed three times for five minutes in TBST and then photographed in the C-DiGit Blot Scanner for Chemiluminescent Westerns. This is accomplished by adding 1.5 mL of luminol and enhancer from the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Chemiluminescent Substrate kit from ThermoScientific in Waltham, Maryland. ImagJ software is used to analyze particular sections of the photograph for the relative concentrations of a particular protein, since the molecular weights of the proteins of interest are known. The optical density of the image at the expected location of a particular protein (as deduced by the location of several markers in the MagicMark ladder) is indicative of its concentration.
